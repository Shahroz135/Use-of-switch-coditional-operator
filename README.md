# Use-of-switch-coditional-operator

 In these programs we make you 
 understand the use of switch 
 and condition operator. Switch 
 is used in "C language" on and
 off. It is remembered that switch 
 can work only integer and characters.
 It is not applicable on floating 
 Point numbers. "Case" is used in 
 switch where the case is matched 
 the statement will executed. 
 "Break" statement is used in 
 it to exit from the statement.
 default(keyword) is used because if
 any "case" is not matched the 
 statement under the default is 
 executed.
 
 Conditional operator is used 
 for ternary expressions to make 
 Decisions.
